# FunWithFlags
A simple game for kids to distinguish between similar flags

My kid is crazy about flags and I wanted to make something that kids will like as well as learn from. Created this simple game where the user has to select from similar looking flags.

There are 2 lists of 25 countries each with mostly similar looking flags in coreesponding positions. The game randomly picks 10 pairs out of these lists and also randomly asks one of the two countries within each pair per game.

Since I built this for younger kids, I have tried to keep the UI as simple as possible with spoken instructions at the start of the game and country name being spoekn for each question.

And as a fun bit in the end, based on the score achieved a funny gif is shown :)

Have added support for Dutch language so that I could share it with the school.
